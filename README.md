# *Prayog* - Where every mistake leads to discovery 

<br/>
    
## Problem Statement
Virtual labs lack personalized learning, as they do not track individual progress, leading to uneven educational experiences. Without smart feedback, students often repeat the same mistakes without guidance for improvement. Additionally, these labs fail to analyze errors, preventing them from predicting learning gaps and warning students about future challenges. The one-size-fits-all approach means every student receives the same experience, regardless of their unique strengths or struggles. Furthermore, the burden falls on teachers to manually track performance, making it difficult to provide real-time feedback and support for the students.

# Project Overview
Prayog revolutionizes virtual science learning by addressing the limitations of traditional labs through personalized, AI-driven guidance via Retrieval-Augmented Generation, coupled with the secure and transparent record-keeping of blockchain technology. This innovative platform empowers students to learn actively from their mistakes with intelligent feedback from Chetna and SIFRA, while ensuring the integrity and auditability of their progress through the Prayog Integrity System. By fostering a learning environment where errors lead to discovery and providing accessible tools for all learners, Prayog sets a new standard for virtual science education, particularly in resource-constrained environments.

## *Introduction*

In India, the scarcity of well-equipped laboratories and the high student-to-teacher ratio severely limit hands‑on science learning—especially in rural areas. Traditional virtual lab platforms lack personalized feedback and tamper-proof record-keeping, leading to inconsistent educational outcomes. LabMate bridges this gap by providing real‑time, adaptive guidance tailored to each student's unique performance profile.By giving them a chance to make errors and learn from it unlik eprewsent OLABS and By harnessing advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques and integrating blockchain for immutable data logging, LabMate ensures that every experiment session is transparent, verifiable, and optimized for continuous learning. This system not only minimizes common experimental errors but also instills confidence in educators and regulators through its secure, decentralized audit trail.

Blockchain ensures that all Scores are secure, transparent, and distributed.

    Data Storage: It defines a structure called ExperimentLog that holds a unique IPFS CID and a timestamp for each experiment session.
    The contract uses a mapping to store an array of these logs for each student’s address, ensuring that each student's experiment history is preserved.

    Immutable Logging:
        Through the storeLog function, when a new experiment session is completed, the system generates a JSON file of the session data and uploads it to IPFS. The returned CID (along with a timestamp) is then stored on-chain.
        This creates an immutable record—once stored, the data cannot be altered, which is critical for maintaining data integrity and trust.

    Transparency & Auditability:
        The smart contract emits an event (LogStored) every time a log is saved. This event can be monitored in real-time, providing an audit trail that educators and regulators can use to verify the authenticity of the experiment data.
        Anyone can retrieve these logs by querying the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency.

    Foundational for Adaptive Learning:
        The secure, immutable logs are later used to feed our adaptive learning system. By analyzing these records, the system can provide personalized feedback based on historical performance, further enhancing the educational experience.

<br/>

> [!TIP]
> In essence, our smart contract guarantees that every experiment session’s data is securely, transparently, and immutably recorded—forming the backbone of our data integrity and trust system in LabMate. This is what sets our solution apart, ensuring that educators and stakeholders can always verify the authenticity of a student’s performance.
